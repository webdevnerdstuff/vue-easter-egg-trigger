## Description

Presenting the Vue Easter Egg Trigger, a tool that discreetly injects a touch of unexpectedness into Vue.js projects. This unassuming plugin, which operates on both keystrokes (with click events also available), brings hidden surprises to your applications.  
  
Picture users navigating through your Vue.js application, tapping out secret combinations akin to the infamous <a  :href="links.konamiCode" target="_blank">Konami code</a>. Suddenly, a magical farting unicorn appears. While we must issue a PSA that this majestic creature isn't included, the plugin serves as an invitation for developers to infuse similar unexpected elements into their projects.
